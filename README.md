# BoardLab

Alternative client for Kilter Board, built with React Native.

Very incomplete, but totally functional for "read-only" usage, if you happen to climb on a 12x12 board with a kickboard.

This client will be doing some "opinionated" stuff like lighting effects, custom roles, integration with generative AI APIs for route generation, using alternative backend servers, etc.

## Database

You'll need to download a database with [`BoardLib`](https://github.com/lemeryfertitta/BoardLib) and place it in `assets/db.sqlite3`.

## Build

`yarn ios`
